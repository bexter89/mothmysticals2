          I use tarot for self-reflection, evolution and empowerment. I, nor the
          cards, can or will predict your future. Instead, I will offer insight
          into the present.
        </p>
        <p className="Tarot-Summary">
          The clearer and more honest we are with our present selves, the
          clearer our desires and path for the future can become. You can expect
          a warm and compassionate space to be witnessed, receive guidance,
          validation, affirmation(s) and general messages in alignment with your
          evolution at this time.
        </p>
        <p className="Tarot-Summary">
          My hope is that you leave your session feeling empowered and spacious
          in the here and now.
